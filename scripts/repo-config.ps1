.SYNOPSIS
    Repo-specific configuration read by the Claude Specialists scripts.
.DESCRIPTION
    Placed by specialists-init. The scripts themselves are repo-agnostic and read this small block of
    repo data from the repo root. Anything below carrying a VUL-IN marker is yours to fill in; a
    section without one is complete as generated.

    No Set-StrictMode here: dot-sourcing would modify calling script's strict mode.
    Pure ASCII (repo convention for .ps1): Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less script as ANSI.

# Repo-root-relative path to the file holding the specialist roster, read by check-roster-sync.
# Points at the seam inclusion, because that is where specialists-init puts the roster slot -- change it
# only if you move the roster somewhere else. Required by the contract, so the scaffold defines it rather
# than leaving the session check to report it against a missing function (issue #226).
#
# It used to say 'CLAUDE.md', which is where the roster lived BEFORE the seam existed. The consequence was
# not cosmetic: the check read a file containing only the @-import, found no roster rows, and reported
# every specialist as missing -- naming CLAUDE.md as the place to fix it, while this bootstrap's own
# next-steps block says the roster does NOT go there (inbound #333).
$script:RosterPath = '.claude/specialists/SPECIALISTS.md'

function Get-RosterPath {

# '<group>-<id>' ids deliberately kept OUT of the roster and lenses. Normally empty: every specialist
# an enabled plugin ships belongs in the roster, and adopting one that arrives with a plugin update is
# the default, not a question. Fill this in only for a deliberate, self-authored exception -- and note
# that without it 'skip this one' is not an implementable outcome at all, which is exactly why the
# contract marks it required.

# Get-PrDescriptionPlaceholder, Get-PrApprovalPattern, Get-PrAssignee, Get-PrMilestone -- and
# open-pr.ps1 picks them up automatically. Left undefined here on purpose: open-pr.ps1 falls back
# to its own built-in defaults (this repo's current markers, no assignee/milestone) when any of
# these four are absent, so a fresh consumer needs none of this to get started.

        Where the hand-written release note is written and read back from.

        Written by adopt-workflow-folder.ps1 rather than left to the shared 'releases/notes' fallback,
        because at the moment that folder was scaffolded this repo defined no answer AND had no note
        of its own at that fallback -- so there was nothing here for this answer to move, and leaving
        it unanswered would have put the notes outside the folder the adoption had just built.

        This is this repo's file now. Edit it freely; nothing overwrites a function already here.
    #>
    'dkj-policy/releases/audience'
}

# --- Adopted from the DKJ-Solutions/dkj-claude-plugins config blueprint ---------------------------------
#
# Each function below is the source's own text, comments included, for a value that states the
# shared way of working rather than a fact about this repo. Edit them freely -- they are this
# repo's files now, and adopt-config never overwrites a function that is already here.

# --- The stub wording new-branch.ps1 writes into an entry file (issue #410) ---------------
#
# The four strings below are the entire visible output of the shared new-branch.ps1: the title
# placeholder, the body heading, the fallback body, and the changelog type an unknown branch prefix
# falls back to. They used to be hardcoded in that script, which is fine for an English repo and wrong
# for any other -- the FILE it writes is repo-owned, so its wording is too.
#
# The concrete case (inbound #410, smartwatchbanden): a Dutch-language repo kept its own copy of
# new-branch.ps1 at the same relative path, purely to change these four strings. Two entry
# points then wrote two formats for the same branch -- the branch flow called the repo copy, the
# new-branch skill called the shared one -- which is exactly the duplication the skill exists to
# prevent. Dropping the copy fixed the duplication and cost them Dutch stubs; these functions give the
# wording back without the copy.
#
# All four are OPTIONAL in the script contract: a consumer that defines none of them gets the values
# below, which are also what the script hardcoded before. Same pattern as Get-ChangelogHeading (#178)
# and Get-LiveStage (#177). Four separate functions rather than one map-returning function, so the
# contract check can name the exact default per knob in its [INFO] line.
#
# TWO OF THEM ARE NOW GATE-ONLY (August 6, 2026). Since the branch/ split, new-branch.ps1 writes
# neither the body heading nor the old to-do placeholder -- branch-cycle.md carries the step list, and
# the entry's placeholder asks what the change DOES. The body heading stays defined here because it is
# still a marker open-pr refuses, so a consumer who translated it keeps a gate that recognises their
# wording rather than only the English one. See $script:EntryScaffoldDefaults in entry-scaffold-lib.ps1.

# --- Which files the mojibake tool examines by default (issue #413) -------------------------------
#
# scripts/maintenance/fix-mojibake.ps1 used to carry this list itself, and the list is workshop-shaped:
# it walks plugins/** for the manuals, agent defs and personas, and releases/** for the archived notes.
# In a consumer neither directory exists, so the tool's own Test-Path filter quietly reduced the set to
# whatever root docs happened to be there -- a gate that examines almost nothing while reporting
# "clean". Which files a repo has is a property of the repo, so the list belongs here.
#
# Takes the repo root as a parameter rather than resolving one of its own: the caller has already done
# that (dual-context, CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR or the git root), and a second resolution here is a second
# answer to a one-answer question. The Get-ChildItem work sits INSIDE the function on purpose -- this
# file is dot-sourced by every workflow script, and none of the others should pay for a directory walk
# they never use.
#
# OPTIONAL in the contract: a consumer without this function gets the tool's own repo-agnostic
# fallback -- every *.md in the repo root, which covers the changelog, the root docs and the unfolded
# entry files in any repo. That fallback is deliberately broader than what this workshop's list used to
# be, because an entry file is exactly the kind of freshly written, non-ASCII-carrying file the damage
# shows up in first.

    # August 26, 2026, #886, and off 'contributing-davekjohn/' on September 5, 2026, #1437). The entry is

    # verbatim into CHANGELOG.md and from there into the release notes, so a mis-decode caught anywhere
    # later has already been copied twice.

# --- Where this repo keeps its release history (Dave, August 4, 2026) -----------------------------
#
# THE MEASUREMENT BEHIND THIS PATH BECOMING LOAD-BEARING. CHANGELOG.md used to carry an accumulating
# release section that had grown to 434 of the file's 1,062 lines -- 41% -- across 72 blocks that each
# said no more than "see the notes". Every one of those 72 versions was ALSO in releases/README.md, with a
# date, a type and a descriptive title: verified in both directions, zero missing either way. So the
# section was not a long list but a poorer copy of a better one, and the changelog's own subject -- what
# changed since the last release -- was sitting under it.
#
# Get-ReleaseHistoryMode retired on August 5, 2026, and this is the other half of that same measurement
# playing out. It chose between 'all' (a block per release) and 'latest' (only the newest, behind a
# pointer); the flat changelog keeps NEITHER, because a cut now empties the document down to its intro.
# There is no mode left to select, and the file below is not "where the pointer points" any more but the
# only list of releases there is.
#
# THE PRECONDITION IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTE RATHER THAN A CAUTION: this file must really list every release,
# because from now on nothing else does. It did before this change too -- that is what made removing the
# blocks safe rather than lossy.
#
# The path answers ONE question and three things read it: the guardrail that checks which major a new row
# would land in, the inserter that writes that row, and new-internal-note.ps1, which repoints that row's
# Version cell at the internal note once the note exists. One edit here moves all three.
#
# IT IS BACK AT THE DEFAULT, releases/README.md, since August 19, 2026 (Dave), and the round trip is the
# instructive part. It moved to the workflow folder on August 14 with the hand-kept release pages, on the
# reasoning that everything the workflow owns gathers in the workflow's own folder. That swept up one
# thing the workflow does NOT own: a repo that has cut releases has a HISTORY, whichever tooling cut it,
# and an index of files living in releases/ had no business sitting in a plugin folder that a teardown
# removes. The audience notes stayed behind deliberately -- those exist only BECAUSE the tier model does,
# so they are the workflow's; the list is not. The list lived in its own HISTORY.md for one day
# (August 4, 2026), on the reasoning that one
# page should describe the process and another the outcome. That reasoning was superseded the same day:
# the pages had since been reorganised portable-half first with everything repo-specific in one named
# slot, and once that split exists, process-versus-outcome stops earning a file boundary -- the outcome
# IS repo-specific content, so it is simply the last section of the slot. Merging them also removed four
# cross-references the two pages needed to introduce each other, and left a consumer with one file to
# mirror instead of two.
# UNDER contributing-davekjohn/ SINCE AUGUST 27, 2026 (Dave), which REVERSES the August 19 answer
# recorded three paragraphs up -- amended rather than silently flipped, so both readings stay legible.
# That answer sent the list back to the repo root on one premise: an index of releases had no business
# sitting in "a plugin folder that a teardown removes". THE PREMISE EXPIRED BEFORE THE ANSWER DID.
# Issue #885 settled that dkj-policy/ is PERMANENT -- no command in this plugin removes it and
# no future teardown may, precisely because it holds a repo's own changelog and release history -- and
# UNINSTALL.md's "what is left behind" list says so to every consumer. Once that is true the durability
# worry is answered a different way, and the folder is the safer home rather than the riskier one. It is
# also the answer the computed default has been giving every CONSUMER since #885; the source was the
# holdout, on a reason that no longer holds.
#
# THE FILENAME CHANGES WITH THE MOVE, and that is not cosmetic: this folder's own 'releases/README.md' is
# its seam-ANSWERS page. The list and the answers are two different documents that shared a filename only
# because they sat at different directory levels. 'history.md' is the name Get-DefaultReleaseHistoryPath
# already computes for a consumer, so the source stops being the one repo that names it differently.
#
# AND UNDER dkj-policy/ SINCE SEPTEMBER 5, 2026 (#1437), when the folder renamed with the plugin it is
# named after. The seam VALUES below carry today's name; every dated sentence around them keeps the name
# it was written with, which is the #952 rule.

# Get-DefaultReleaseInternalNotesRoot would answer 'releases/internal' here -- the source branch of that
# default -- and recreate a root releases/ directory the August 27, 2026 move above just emptied. The
# other two generated roots (changelog/, github/) need no statement: their defaults stopped branching on

}

# --- Where this repo keeps its changelog (Dave, August 27, 2026) -----------------------------------
#
# THE SAME MOVE, ON THE SAME DAY AND FOR THE SAME REASON as the release history above -- read that record
# first. Get-DefaultChangelogPath computes 'CHANGELOG.md' for a repo that publishes plugins, i.e. for the
# workflow's SOURCE, and 'dkj-policy/CHANGELOG.md' for everybody else. This repo is the source
# and now answers the consumer's way, so the seam has to be stated rather than left to the default.
#
# NOT A CHANGE OF MIND ABOUT THE DEFAULT. The default is right about what a repo adopting this workflow
# should get and says nothing about what THIS repo prefers; the seam exists for exactly this, a repo that
# wants to differ from its computed answer. Nothing about a consumer changes here.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS. A relative link inside a changelog entry now resolves from dkj-policy/ rather
# than from the repo root, because that is where the fold pastes it. new-branch composes the branch
# document's guidance from this very seam, so a writer is told the right thing without having to know it,
# and check-plugin-integrity validates each entry's links against the same resolved location.

# THE ALWAYS-ON CEILING (issue #2037, Dave September 16, 2026): how many BYTES the always-on document
# path -- CLAUDE.md plus everything it '@'-imports -- may cost, before a single assignment is given.
#
# 100,000 IS DAVE'S OWN FIGURE and it is stated here rather than left to the built-in default, because a
# ceiling a repo has never said out loud is one nobody can argue with. Every measurable repo running
# this workflow was over it the day it was measured, the source repo included and smallest of the four
# at 109,385 B -- which is why the gate is a RATCHET rather than a cliff: over the ceiling it refuses
# growth against a recorded baseline, at or under it it refuses crossing. The mechanism, and why the
# judgement stays out of measure-context-lib, are in scripts/lib/always-on-budget-lib.ps1.
#
# RAISING THIS IS A REAL OPTION AND IT IS MEANT TO BE VISIBLE. A repo whose path is legitimately bigger
# raises the number here, where the raise sits in a tracked file and gets reviewed with the change that
# needed it -- which is the whole difference between this seam and no bound at all. What it must NOT
# become is the way past a red gate: the PATH's own baseline is what moves in that case
# (check-always-on-budget.ps1 -Raise), because that write carries a reason and this one does not.
#
# BYTES, NOT TOKENS, and the unit is not arbitrary. No API prices a document, so a token figure here
# would be a calibrated estimate wearing the trousers of a measurement -- the exact failure
# measure-context-lib.ps1 records as this repo's worst: a chars-per-token factor inherited unexamined
# through three re-measurements, ~19% too generous, every derived figure under-stated while looking
# precise. A byte is checkable with `wc -c`.

# --- The triage-priority labels every dkj-policy consumer is invited to share (issue #1895) ---------
#
# THE GAP. `.claude/specialists/lenses/specialist-01-01-lens.md` already prescribes a priority label on
# every issue filed HERE -- 'prio-1' (lowest) through 'prio-4' (highest) -- but until now that scale
# was prose in one family's page and `dkj-policy` itself knew none of it. #1895 (split from #1843)
# asked three questions, and Dave answered all three on September 12, 2026:
#
#   1. Apply or print?  PRINT. adopt-triage-labels.ps1 composes the exact `gh label create` a person
#      would type and stops, on the same reasoning Get-MissingLabelNote already applies to a PR
#      label: creating a label is a GitHub-side write, and a script that quietly created or
#      substituted one would break any repo that later gates on it.
#   2. Is there a shared set at all?  YES, one set -- not a per-consumer table.
#   3. Where is it declared?  HERE, in its own seam -- not in branch-info.ps1 (see AdoptWhy below).
#
# 'copy', NOT 'decide', AND THE REASONING IS Get-ReachLabel's, ONE AXIS OVER (issue #1870), NOT
# Get-BranchInfo's. A 'decide' value states WHAT THE REPO IS -- Get-BranchInfo's three prefixes exist
# because THIS repo lands a release directly on its trunk, and copying that table into a consumer with
# a different policy would impose it on them. 'prio-1' through 'prio-4' assert nothing about the
# adopting repo at all: they are four rungs of urgency, and the rungs mean the same thing in every
# repo that adopts them -- the shared WAY OF WORKING Get-ReachLabel's own AdoptWhy already argues for
# the neighbouring axis. Refusing to share them would leave every dkj-policy consumer to reinvent four
# names and four colours on their own, which is the exact "prose in one family's page" #1895 was filed
# about.
#
# NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS #1686, AND NOT A REVERSAL OF IT. #1686 (closed September 9, 2026) kept this
# repo's `prio-*` rungs and the BWJ tracker's own reach BUCKETS deliberately disjoint, in both
# directions, so a session crossing families gets a refused label rather than one that quietly means
# something else there. This seam does not touch dkj-policy-bwj's buckets or Get-ReachLabel's reach
# axis at all -- it only offers the priority axis to an ORDINARY dkj-policy consumer, one with no BWJ
# board of its own, which is a question #1686 never asked.
#
# THE VALUES ARE THIS REPO'S OWN LIVE LABELS, read back from `gh label list` rather than invented for
# this function -- this repo already runs the convention its own orchestrator prescribes, so its
# answer IS the canonical one instead of a guess at what it should be. adopt-triage-labels.ps1 carries
# the same four values as its own built-in fallback, for a consumer that has not yet adopted this seam
# -- see that script's header for why the two copies must stay byte-identical, the same duality
# Get-EntryFallbackType's 'Chore' already has with entry-scaffold-lib.ps1.
#
# NO SCRIPT IN THIS WORKFLOW READS THIS EITHER, same as the priority axis has never been read by
# anything here (see Get-ReachLabel's own AdoptWhy for why that is not disqualifying): `gh issue
# create` fails outright on a label the repo does not have, so the four records below exist to be
# composed into a paste-ready `gh label create` line by adopt-triage-labels.ps1 rather than typed by
# hand into four separate terminals with four separate chances to mistype a hex colour.
#
# AND A FIFTH RECORD THAT IS NOT A RUNG: 'dossier' (issue #2462, Dave September 24, 2026). A dossier is
# a collecting issue -- every instance of one recurring problem is added to it as a comment until the
# root cause is found, and no single repair closes it (#2454 was the first). It is a KIND of issue, not
# an urgency, so it sits beside the rungs rather than among them: a dossier carries a prio-* label of
# its own like any other issue. Dave ruled it a shared way of working rather than this repo's own label,
# which is what puts it in this seam -- the same 'copy' reasoning as the rungs, since what a dossier is
# asserts nothing about the adopting repo. The handling rule lives in CONTRIBUTING-portable.md.
#
# AND A SIXTH, A PARKING LABEL: 'needs-decision' (issue #2519, Dave September 26, 2026). An issue that
# ends in an open choice for the owner is not work anybody can pick up yet, and the claim and sweep
# routes skip it by default. It is deliberately NOT 'needs-info': in dkj-policy-bwj that label means
# blocked on the SUBMITTER -- it moves the mirrored Asana card to the blocked column and obliges a
# question comment to the person who filed it -- and neither is true of a decision that is the owner's.
# Same 'copy' reasoning: "waiting on the owner" asserts nothing about the adopting repo.
#
# AND A SEVENTH, A SECOND PARKING LABEL: 'awaiting-recurrence' (issue #2587, Dave September 28, 2026).
# An issue with one unreproduced instance whose only remaining step is its FIRST reproducible occurrence
# was picked up four times in one day (#2572), each pickup finding nothing to build. It is deliberately
# NOT 'dossier': a dossier collects a problem that demonstrably recurs. (A dossier is parked TOO since
# September 30, 2026 -- Dave: it waits on its next instance or its root cause, so no sweep can finish
# one -- but it keeps its own label, because it also changes how the issue is closed.) Once a
# recurrence arrives the label comes off and the issue is worked, or becomes a dossier if it keeps
# recurring. Same 'copy' reasoning: "waiting on evidence" asserts nothing about the adopting repo.

# THE NAME THE CUT ACTUALLY LOOKS FOR FIRST (inbound #605). cut-release.ps1 reads
# Get-ReleaseNoteWording and only falls back to Get-InternalNoteWording above -- so until this existed,
# this repo was being served by the retired name and had no way to notice. Nothing was broken, which is
# precisely why it went two releases undeclared: the fallback works, so no run ever complains.
#
# A SEPARATE MAP RATHER THAN AN ALIAS, because the two documents do not share a key set. This one is the
# ONE hand-written release note (a named section per reader): Title, AudienceLabel, Audience,
# SectionAudience, HintAudience, SectionValue, HintValue, SectionOpen, HintOpen. The four keys above
# that are missing here -- SkeletonNote, SectionChanged, NoEntries, Unknown -- belong to
# new-internal-note.ps1, which is still shipped and which nothing here calls.
#
# SectionAudience/HintAudience WERE SectionConsumers/HintConsumers until inbound #747, and both old names
# are still read -- "recognise both, write one". The rename is not cosmetic: that section now follows
# Get-ReleaseAudienceTier, so in a tier-1 repo it addresses the organisation, and a key whose own name said
# "consumers" would describe the wrong reader. A repo that overrode the old name keeps its heading.
#
# EMPTY HERE, for the same reason as its neighbour: an English repo is already served by the English
# defaults in the script. Merged over them, so overriding one leaves the rest alone.

# --- The internal tier's own text (the third tier, August 3, 2026) --------------------------------
#
# releases/internal/<X>.x/<X.Y.Z>.md, written by new-internal-note.ps1 for colleagues, employers and
# management -- at EVERY release including a patch, which is exactly what separates it from the consumer
# document: that one is what a CONSUMER notices, this one is what the ORGANISATION gets out of it. A
# release with nothing for a consumer (correctly a patch, so no consumer document) can still be the one
# where a team stopped needing a developer for a routine change.
#
# NO ON/OFF KNOB, deliberately, unlike the consumer tier. That tier is generated BY cut-release, so it
# needs to be told whether to run; this one is a script you invoke when you want a note. The switch is
# running it or not. cut-release only decides whether to PRINT the suggestion, and it does that by
# checking whether the script exists in the repo -- a fact rather than a preference, the same reasoning
# as Get-ReleasePluginTier's computed fallback.
#
# EMPTY HERE, for the third time in this file and for the same reason: an English repo is already served
# by the English defaults in the script. The knob exists for a consumer whose colleagues read another
# language, where an unset heading is the wrong word rather than a missing one -- the #410 class. Keys:
# Title, AudienceLabel, Audience, SkeletonNote, SectionChanged, SectionValue, HintValue, SectionOpen,
# HintOpen, NoEntries, Unknown. Merged over the defaults, so overriding one leaves the rest alone.
